//need a module designing the user interface
// app will have two images
//overflow: most useful widget that is expanded class to fix the pixel of the image
// or layout of the image
// copy and paste expanded widget in the Row
//add flex in the expanded widget to increase or decrease the space occupy by each dice
//if both the dice need same space from the screen no need to flex
